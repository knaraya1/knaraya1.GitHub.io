        <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale University School of Art</a></h3>
        <p>This is a website for the Yale University that offers undergraduate-level art courses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C: </strong>The page has strong contrast between each of its sections. However, the headings' low contrast with the dark background makes some of them hard to read.</li>
            <li><strong>R: </strong>Some of the sections of the page are repeated, while other sections are only displayed once and stand out too much.</li>
            <li><strong>A: </strong>The page features some alignment on the left, but other sections are scattered throughout the page, especially near the center.</li>
            <li><strong>P: </strong>Only some related sections are together, while others which are different are spread or also close together</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

    <section class="good">
        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>
        <p>This website is for shopping and ordering online.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C: </strong>The colors of the text and the background of the website are clearly different and make all text easy to read.</li>
            <li><strong>R: </strong>The page repeats similar sections in a grid like layout that make navigating easier.</li>
            <li><strong>A: </strong>The alignment of the grid layout is neat, as well as the content of the footer.</li>
            <li><strong>P: </strong>All the different sections in the grid layout are close together while the nav bar is separated with a banner.</li>
        </ul>
